# py_seed
Seed for python projects

## Integrating with the seed
1. Copy content of `py_seed` repository
2. Edit the information in the file `pyproyect.toml`
3. Clean the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files
4. Rename the package into `src` and `test`
5. Clean the `__init__.py` files inside `src` and `tests`
6. Removing the `example.py` and `test_example.py` files inside `src` and `tests`
7. Create the virtual environment, it will be called `venv` or `venvVERSION` for example `venv311` for Python 3.11.*.
8. Install poetry with `pip install poetry`
9. Install project dependencies with `poetry install --with dev,tests,docs` or Update project dependencies with `poetry update --with dev,tests,docs`

## Groups of Dependencies
### Optionals
- **docs** > To generate the documentation
- **tests** > To generate reports and execute various tests such as unit tests, format tests, etc.
- **dev** > Tools to develop *(Mandatory if we are going to use development scripts.)*

## Scripts
To execute the scripts, will be used as follows:
`poe NAME_OF_SCRIPT`
### Build
- **build** > Deletes all previously generated builds and generates a new one
- **build-clean** > Deletes all previously generated builds
### Documentation
- **doc** > Deletes the previously generated documentation and generates a new one.
- **doc-clean** > Deletes the previously generated documentation
### Dependencies
- **export-dependencies** > Deletes the file with the previously exported dependencies and generates a new one
- **export-dependencies-clean** > Deletes the file with the previously exported dependencies
- **outdated-dependencies** > Deletes the file with all outdated dependencies and generate a file with all
outdated dependencies
- **outdated-dependencies-clean** > Deletes the file containing all outdated dependencies
### Tests
- **test-changelog** > Validate if the CHANGELOG format is correct
- **test-linter** > Validates if the format, the cyclomatic complexity and the code is secure.
- **test-linter-clean** > Deletes the reports previously generated by the linter.
- **test-tests** > Run the unit tests and report which ones have passed and which ones have failed, also report the
code coverage of these tests.
- **test-tests-clean** > Deletes previously generated test reports and code coverage reports
- **test-typing** > Validates if code typing is correct
- **test-typing-clean** > Deletes previously generated typing reports
- **test** > Runs all tests
- **test-clean** > Delete all test reports
### All
- **all** > Execute all scripts
- **clean** > Removes everything generated by scripts

## Directory and File Structure
### Directories
- **.ipynb_checkpoints** > Jupyter saving points
- **.mypy_cache** > mypy cache
- **dist** > Where the builds will be stored
- **docs** > All about self-generated documentation
    - **dist** > HTML Documentation
    - **src** > Files needed to generate HTML documentation
- **reports** > All about reports
    - **coverage** > Code coverage of tests
    - **linter** > Report on formatting, cyclomatic complexity and insecure code
    - **tests** > Report on which tests have passed and which have failed.
    - **typing** > Report on code typing
- **scripts** > Code functions to execute routine tasks such as generating reports, generating documentation, etc.
- **src** > Application code
- **tests** > Application test code
- **venv** > Python Virtual Environment (Can also be called **venv311** for example to specify a specific version)
### Files
- **.editorconfig** > Configuration for standard code formatting (end of line, line length, etc.)
- **.gitignore** > Configuration of directories and files on which version control is not to be applied
- **CHANGELOG.md** > List of changes
- **dependencies_bom.xml** > Dependencies in BOM format
- **dependencies_outdated.txt** > List of outdated dependencies
- **dev.ipynb** > Jupyter notebook for testing code during development
- **dev.py** > Python file for testing code during development
- **jenkinsfile** > Pipeline for jenkins CI
- **nose2.cfg** > Configuration of nose2
- **poetry.lock** > File containing the exact versions of the libraries for everyone to use the same ones
- **pyproject.toml** > Project configuration file (Name, version, tool configurations, dependencies, etc.)
- **README.md** > Introduction file to the repository where an introduction to work with this repository is made.
